							<p>We are a student organization that recognizes that cohesiveness and true power comes from diversity. We endeavor to promote awareness, within and beyond the Latino/Latina community, that incorporates all facets of our culture rooted in Indigenous, African, and European ancestry. It is our mission to promote political, social, cultural and ethnic awareness that furthers the progression of the Latino/a community on both a collegiate and a community plane and to facilitate cultural exchange and knowledge.</p>

							<h2>Board</h2>
							<table><tr><td>Exequiel Manbor</td><td>emanbor@uchicago.edu</td><td>President</td><td>I am a fourth year at the University studying Economics with interests in language, culture and the social sciences in general. I was born and raised in Santiago, Chile and at UChicago have always looked for outlets to remind myself of my home. After a successful organization of our cultural show last year, I became president for OLAS. Latin American culture is becoming more dominant in the US and we strive to break stereotypes and share the diversity of our worlds, as well as serve as a space that reminds some people of home.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Luisa Sepulveda</td><td></td><td>Vice President</td><td>I am a third year public policy and psychology double major from Colombia. Coming from a tight-knit Colombian family, I knew that I could find a home away from home with OLAS, allowing me to stay grounded to my Latin roots.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Camila Y. Cuesta Arcentales</td><td>ccuestaa@uchicago.edu</td><td>Communications Chair</td><td>I am a second year pursuing a double major in Comparative Human Development and Computer Science. Despite growing up in Chicago, my parents made sure my upbringing would be heavily saturated with my Ecuadorian roots and a socio-political awareness of my Latin American heritage. OLAS is community that makes me feel welcome to agree and/or disagree and that’s why it's great.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Maya Rodriguez</td><td>mayar34@uchicago.edu</td><td>Logistics Chair</td><td>I'm a third year psychology major also pursuing the pre-medicine track. Even though I have been raised in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago, it wasn't until high school when I embraced my heritage. Now, I'm thankful to have found a wonderful home in OLAS with friends who continue to support this exploration of our cultures.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Juan Anderson</td><td>andersonjc@uchicago.edu</td><td>Finance Chair</td><td>I'm a second year planning to major in Economics and Sociology with a specialization in Urban Development.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Paulina Torres-Orejuela</td><td>ptorres@uchicago.edu</td><td>Co-Director of Community Service Committee</td><td>I am a second year planning to major in Public Policy with a specialization in urban education. After dancing a Colombian fusion routine at the OLAS Cultural Show last spring, I met some incredible people who introduced me to this community on campus, and I’m so excited to be a part of it this year!</td></tr>
