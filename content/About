What is OLAS?
We are a student organization that recognizes that cohesiveness and true power comes from diversity. We endeavor to promote awareness, within and beyond the Latino/Latina community, that incorporates all facets of our culture rooted in Indigenous, African, and European ancestry. It is our mission to promote political, social, cultural and ethnic awareness that furthers the progression of the Latino/a community on both a collegiate and a community plane and to facilitate cultural exchange and knowledge.

Our Mission
The Organization of Latin American Studentsâ€™ (OLAS) purpose is composed of three main goals:

To serve as a general support network for its members and all undergraduate and graduate Latino students at the University of Chicago.

To educate its members and the university community about diverse Latino cultures.

To foster awareness of ourselves as students, citizens, Latinos and active participants in several communities.

What We Do
Community: We strive to foster an immersive and supportive community for Latin Americans and invite our non-Latin American friends to join us in forming positive relations between each other and the greater Chicago community.

Culture: We strive to promote an immersive culturally rich Latin American environment through hosting workshops, fostering productive discussions, and promoting community events.

Connections: We strive to be a resource for our members by connecting them to the opportunities available on and off campus.
