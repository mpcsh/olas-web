The Organization of Latin American Students at the University of Chicago is the official Latin-American student organization that recognizes that cohesiveness and true power comes from diversity. 

We endeavor to promote awareness, within and beyond the Latin American community, that incorporates all facets of our culture rooted in Indigenous, African, and European ancestry. 

It is our mission to promote political, social, cultural and ethnic awareness that furthers the progression of the community on both collegiate and community planes.

We aim to accomplish this through the union of all Latinos and students interested in Latino culture. We firmly believe that through our collaborative efforts we can ensure the appreciation, promotion, and furthering of our diverse Hispanic heritages.
